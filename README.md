# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸ©ºðŸ¤–
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical and demographic data. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving early diagnosis.
Machine Learning Workflow

## Data Preprocessing:
* Handling missing or inconsistent data.
* Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, smoking history).
* Scaling numerical features for better model performance.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

## Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.
* Identifying important features influencing diabetes prediction.

## Model Development:
* Training and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
Random Forest
XGBoost
CatBoost
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Model Evaluation:
Metrics used:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC curve to evaluate model classification performance.

## Key Results
The model achieved [97% accuracy] on the test set.
